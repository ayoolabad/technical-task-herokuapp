Technical task on Herokuapp. 
This is a selenium, cucumber framework using Gherkin Syntax and Junit.
I have created three feature files.  
To run the test, please go to the TestRunner to pass each files tag. 

Please note- I did not use PageObject for all tasks. Although, I can use it to run others.
This framework is run on Chromedriver but, I can run frameworks on  other browsers as well.
